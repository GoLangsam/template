Package `template` implements the interface common to the standard packages
`"text/template"` and `"html/template"` as type `Template`.

Thus, it exploits the fact, that

	  package `html/template` provides the same interface as package `text/template`
	  and should be used instead of `text/template` whenever the output is HTML
	  as it automatically secures HTML output against certain attacks.

as said in `go doc text/template` and `go doc html/template`.

All methods and all package level functions are forewarded.

Instead of a single `New(name)` this package unsurprisingly provides
two constructors:

- `template.Text(name)` &

- `template.Html(name)`.

Note: The package level functions `ParseFiles` & `ParseGlob` became

- `ParseTextFiles` / `ParseHtmlFile` resp.

- `ParseTextGlob` / `ParseHtmlGlob`.

Thus, the exported type `Template` represents the template used,
be it `html` or `text`.

Also the type `FuncMap` is forwarded.

Note: Clients in need to access any other type

- such as `ExecError` (from `"text/template"`) or

- data types such as `HTML`, `CSS`, `JS` and friends

- as well as `Error` and `ErrorCode` (from `"html/template"`)

are requested to use the respective standard package directly for access to the error and data types.

For example `escape_test.go` uses

	  import( data "html/template" )

and refers to

	  data.HTML, data.CSS, data.JS ...

later.
